I went on the internet to find a poem to read.
There was no obvious place to find a poem.
This disheartened me.

As a person who knows nothing about poetry
Except that he likes it
I want to find popular poems, like really fast

I want there to be a Pandora of Poetry.
(Hey, Pandora's Box, I like the concept {I'm still looking for a domain name})

Rule number one:
	You can write poetry without an account.
	But if you want the poem to have your name on it, you've got to sign up.
	
Rule number two:
	I can rate and poem "good" or "bad"
	This is the thumbs-up, thumbs-down thing you see all over the place
	
Rule number three:
	Nothing is good or bad but tagging makes it so.
	:good and :bad are just symbols
	binary logic is for computers
	long story short, I want to search by tags too, and add my own to poems
	
Rule number four:
	I'm not sure yet whether you need to be logged in to add tags
	Voting, at a minimum, needs to be open to the public
	Why?
	Because it pisses me off 
	When I find an answer I really like on Yahoo Answers
	And I click "thumbs up"
	Then I get redirected to a login page (no message)
	When I click "Sign Up"
	Then I see "okay, now here's a form that'll take you about five minutes to fill out"
	
	ugh
	
	Anyway, rule number four is you can contribute a lot, as long as you're willing to be anonymous.
